Description
-----------

toggle-airport is a utility that auto-disables the Mac's AirPort when wired ethernet is available.


Installation
------------

Download [Toggle AirPort.dmg][dmg] containing the pkg installer for use with the Max OS X installer.

### Optional

To enable [Growl][growl] notifications, the <code>growlnotify</code> utility is needed (and can be found in the **Extras** folder in the [Growl][growl] dmg).

I did not write the script nor launch agent plist that makes this possible, I simply whipped up a quick package to make the installation a bit simpler.
The script and plist file originated from [Mac OS X Hints][origin].
