Description

toggle-airport is a utility that auto-disables the Mac's airport when wired ethernet is available.


Installation
------------

From the Terminal:
	$ wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/twyatt/toggle-airport/raw/master/toggle-airport.zip
	$ unzip toggle-airport.zip
	$ cd toggle-airport/
	$ sudo make install

I did not write the script nor launch agent plist that makes this possible, I simply whipped up a quick Makefile to make the installation a bit simpler.
The script and plist file originated from [Mac OS X Hints][origin].
